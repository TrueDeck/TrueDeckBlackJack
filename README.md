# TrueDeckBlackJack
This is an early version of TrueDeck BlackJack SmartContract, when TrueDeck team started to work on it.

It's a very basic contract, created just to understand how a BlackJack SmartContract can be implemented on Solidity.
This SmartContract is not the current approach that TrueDeck is using in its current BlackJack Beta dApp.

This version of BlackJack SmartContract will also make us remember that how far we have gone to optimize the BlackJack SmartContract to use less and less gas.

_**NOTE: THIS SMART-CONTRACT SHOULD NOT BE USED TO CREATE PRODUCTION-READY CASINO DAPPS. CURRENT APPROACH OF TRUEDECK CASINO SMART-CONTRACTS IS MUCH MORE ADVANCED AND OPTIMIZED TO BE USED ON ENTERPRISE SCALE.**_
